EX^N - Extra X to the Power of N
================================
exn is an extremely fast, small and straightforward window manager
for X.
    
It is designed to be a completely different way of managing windows
-- each monitor only displays one window at a time and all window
placement and management is controlled with the keyboard.


Requirements
------------
In order to build exn you need the Xlib and Xinerama header files.
