EX^N - Extra X to the Power of N
================================
exn is an extremely fast, small and straightforward window manager
for X.
    
It is designed to be a completely different way of managing windows
-- each monitor only displays one window at a time and all window
placement and management is controlled with the keyboard.


Requirements
------------
In order to build exn you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (exn is installed into
the /usr namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install exn (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running exn
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start exn using startx:

    exec exn

In order to connect exn to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec exn

(This will start exn on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of exn is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code. (Eventually)
